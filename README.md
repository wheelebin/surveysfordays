# SurveysForDays

I wanted to learn more about NextJs by building a project, I got a little carried away and this is the result of that.

### With this survey form builder you can:

1. Create a survey
2. Build out the questions
3. Publish the survey (Allowing it to be viewed by unauthenticated users who can complete the survey)
4. See the results of the completed surveys by users

I haven't made any steps towards making this production ready or optimizing anything, it's simply just a side project.

# Good ol' To Do

## Doing

- Add feedback to actions in application (On save, publish and etc..)
